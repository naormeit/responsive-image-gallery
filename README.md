# Responsive Image Gallery

This project demonstrates the creation of a **responsive image gallery** using HTML and CSS. The gallery adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, utilizing **CSS Grid** to create a clean, organized layout for images. It also ensures that images are displayed in a visually appealing way, maintaining their aspect ratio and rounded corners.

## Features
- A **3x3 grid layout** for the image gallery.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **CSS Grid** used for flexible and organized image arrangement.
- Images are displayed with **rounded corners** for aesthetic appeal.
- Maintains **aspect ratio** for images while filling the grid cells.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the image gallery.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and making the gallery responsive using **CSS Grid**.
  
## How It Works
- The gallery uses a **3x3 grid layout** where each image is placed in its own grid cell.
- The images are set to **fill the grid cells horizontally** while maintaining their **aspect ratio**.
- **CSS Grid properties** ensure that the gallery adjusts to different screen sizes, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.
- The images also have **rounded corners** to enhance the visual appeal of the gallery.
